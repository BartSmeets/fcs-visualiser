You are free to add extra functions to this file. Just put a comment above the function "NOT WRITTEN BY JOHAN BUT BY ...."
DO NOT MODIFY any functions. If you think I made a mistake e-mail JohanvanderTol@outlook.com first. Especially with timings given the large number of internal delays you may have misunderstood something, you don't want to take that risk
We save the physical parameters. These might not correspond to the delay generator. These codes generates physical parameters to save from delay generator settings, and reproduces original delay generator settings from physical parameters. Accounting for internal delays.
Also be aware that if a value is already negative, you still need to type +, to avoid --. This seems obvious, but I am afraid someone thinks "hey this time is added, it should be substracted", thinking I made a mistake when I didn't.
